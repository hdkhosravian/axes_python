# README
I'm trying to create a machine learning NLP project with Python, Ruby on Rails and React.
I created this project with `AXES` name, and you can access to complete of the project with this address: [Axes World](http://www.axes.world) ( I'm working on it to make it alive, so please wait for a little)
<br />

I'm trying to make this code clean, and this is just an MVP project. So please wait for it ðŸ˜„!
